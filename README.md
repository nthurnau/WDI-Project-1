# Harry Potter Quiz Game
This game was generated by Nicole Thurnau as her first project for General Assembly's WDI course in Santa Monica. All content is based on J.K Rowling's Harry Potter series. In addition, I would like to dedicate this game to the memory of Alan Rickman, who so artfully played my favorite character, Severus Snape.

### Objective
The Harry Potter Quiz Game is meant to test your Harry Potter knowledge. You compete against a (hopefully) worthy opponent by selecting a card with a trivia question on it, waiting for the animations to finish, answering the question, and earning points. The person with the most points wins!

### Project Requirements
The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

##### Technical Requirements

The App Must:

* Render a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


##### Necessary Deliverables
* A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. (you're reading this now!).

### Technoligies Used
* Object Oriented JavaScript
* JQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Magic :)

### Approach Taken

* 1) First I made a wireframe of my project. It looked like this:
<body>
<img src ='./wireframe.jpg' alt="Wireframe" width = 300px height = 300px>
</body>
* 2) Then I made a planning board on Trello. I created user stories and a to-do list.
* 3) I began coding my HTML and CSS in order to make the layout. I added a variety of div containers to hold all of my game elements.
* 4) I used JavaScript and JQuery to add logic, animations, and functionality to my game.
* 5) I frequently committed my work to the git repository housed inside of my project folder and made branches accordingly.
* 6) I tested my game by asking folks to play it. I made note of the bugs and things that I did not like about it, then problem solved.
* 7) I pushed my branch to the project master and then pushed the project to GitHub.
* 8) I created a live web version of my game and distributed it to my friends and the world!



### Unsolved Problems
* I am not sure that I like the alignment of the elements on the page. Some things are tricky to organize!
* Sometimes the animations and alerts overlap.
* The game is not responsive, so it only really works on one page size.
* I wasn't able to figure out how to completely stop the game.
* I think that a player could change his or her answer.
* If someone clicks a "house box" before the question is done running, it causes the question to repeat and sometimes the answers don't appear.
* If the player doesn't click by the time the multiple choice animation ends, the turn isn't logged, so the game is delayed.
