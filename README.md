# Harry Potter Quiz Game
This game was generated by Nicole Thurnau as her first project for General Assembly's WDI course in Santa Monica.

### Objective
The Harry Potter Quiz Game is meant to test your Harry Potter knowledge. You compete against a (hopefully) worthy opponent by selecting a card with a trivia question on it, answering the question, and earning points. The person with the most points wins! The person with the least points suffers a horrible demise (jk not really).

### Project Requirements
The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

##### Technical Requirements

The App Must:

* Render a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


##### Necessary Deliverables
* A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. (you're reading this now!).

### Technoligies Used

### Approach Taken

* 1) First I made a wireframe of my project. It looked like this:
<body>
<img src ='./wireframe.jpg' alt="Wireframe" width = 300px height = 300px>
* 2) Then I made a


### Unsolved Problems
I haven't started yet so I don't know!
